<h1>Electric Charge</h1>
<p>Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. Electric charge can be positive or negative. Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. An object with no net charge is referred to as electrically neutral.</p>
<p>The basic unit of electric charge is the coulomb, which is the charge of 6.24 x 10<sup>18</sup> electrons. Electrons have a negative charge, and protons have a positive charge. The number of protons in an atom is equal to the number of electrons, so an atom is electrically neutral. However, if an atom loses or gains electrons, it will have a net charge.</p>
<p>Electric charge is conserved. This means that the total electric charge in an isolated system cannot change. When electrons are transferred from one object to another, the total amount of charge remains the same.</p>
<p>Electric charge is responsible for many of the phenomena we see in the world around us. For example, it is responsible for the attraction between magnets, the force that holds atoms together, and the flow of electricity.</p>
<p>Here are some of the common ways to create electric charge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friction: When two objects rub against each other, electrons can be transferred from one object to the other. This creates a difference in charge between the two objects.</li>
<li>Conducting materials: When a conductor is placed in an electric field, the electrons in the conductor can move freely. This movement of electrons is called current.</li>
<li>Electrostatic induction: When a charged object is brought near a neutral object, the neutral object can be polarized. This means that the positive and negative charges in the neutral object are redistributed, creating a difference in charge.</li>
<li>Thermionic emission: When a material is heated to a high temperature, electrons can be emitted from the material. This is called thermionic emission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter, and it is essential for many of the phenomena we see in the world around us.</p>
